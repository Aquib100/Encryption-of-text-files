# Encryption of text files
This repository contains two windows applications (exe) that are interdependent on each other. One app will be used to create encrypted text files and the other will be used to decrypt the encrypted text files.

The file extension of the encrypted text file is **.enct**.

**ENCT** - **Enc**rypted **T**ext
